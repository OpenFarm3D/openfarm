                    <dd><strong>Affiliations:</strong> <br>Josh is a core maintainer of OpenFarm, an open-source management platform for 3D printer farms, where he focuses on distributed backends and a reliable, streaming microservice architecture.</dd>
                    <dd><strong>Interests:</strong> His research interests center on leveraging AI and systems expertise to build next-generation machine learning solutions, with a focus on multimodal agents, world models, embodied AI, and continual learning. He is particularly motivated to advance memory and learning in AI systems, developing agents that form richer internal representations, recall and adapt knowledge over long horizons, and transfer skills across tasks and modalities. By combining structured world models with scalable memory architectures and lifelong learning techniques, he aims to create AI that learns efficiently from sparse signals, resists catastrophic forgetting, and improves through ongoing interaction. Josh will soon join Professor Brown at the University of Utah to contribute to an interdisciplinary project at the intersection of reinforcement learning and neuroscience.</dd>
